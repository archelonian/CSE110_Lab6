Over 350,000 people are using Brackets every month. There have been 283 contributors to the project and users have installed 890 different extensions. The community has also become even more active in the project over the past couple of months. We'll soon be releasing Brackets 1.5 which has a number of fixes and enhancements that were contributed by the community.  \r\n \r\nThe Brackets team at Adobe has been spending the past couple of months talking a lot about how we can continue to move the project forward. We all believe that Brackets is the absolute best code editor out there for the web and the success of Brackets has led to some very good discussion about how Adobe can make our commercial tools better, especially our flagship web tool Dreamweaver. We understand that any good web tool needs to have a powerful code editor at its core.  \r\n \r\nAfter discussing how we recreate Brackets features in Dreamweaver, we realized it would be more logical to <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.adobe.com\/dreamweaver\/2015\/10\/next-generation-of-dreamweaver.html\">use Brackets as the code editor for Dreamweaver<\/a> and are going to start working on that plan. \r\n \r\nThis won't have any impact on how Adobe will support the open source project. Brackets itself will remain 100% free and open source. Adobe will continue to maintain a strong engineering team on the project and actively engage and support the community. We will also continue to add features to Brackets and as we do the integration work we'll be adding a number of core features to the open source project. But it will also mean that overall progress may be slow in the short term as the team works on both the integration work and the core product. As performance issues or bugs come up and get fixed while working on the Dreamweaver integration, we plan to fix those in Brackets directly and contribute them back to the open source project.  \r\n \r\nOnce the integration work is done, which should be in the next 6-9 months, the development team will once again be focusing on Brackets. We will continue to add features and improvements to Brackets which will then make their way into Dreamweaver by virtue of the open source project. We will be working directly in the core Brackets codebase, not a fork, so that features and enhancements benefit the community as well as Dreamweaver.  \r\nThe Adobe team continues to be both humbled and inspired by the way the community contributes to Brackets and moves the project forward. Brackets has always belonged to the community and that community has never been stronger than it is now. We are excited about this new phase because it allows the Adobe team  to spend time on Brackets while also making an impact on Adobe\u2019s commercial tools.  \r\n \r\nBe on the look out for the 1.5 release over the next couple of weeks. It's a great release with a number of enhancements and fixes, most of which have come directly from community contributors.

We now have over 270,000 monthly active users!","excerpt":"Today we are releasing Brackets 1.4, that has some great features which include, the new instant search, better preferences editability to name a few. Instant Search Say hello to instant search! Searching across files in Brackets has never been this fast. We have worked ground up to improve the performance of find in files inside [&hellip;]","date":"2015-07-27 05:01:49","author":"Prashanth Nethi","categories":["releases"],"tags":[]},{"id":1856,"title":"Update on 1.4 and a Brackets Roadmap","permalink":"http:\/\/blog.brackets.io\/2015\/06\/10\/update-on-1-4-and-a-brackets-roadmap\/","content":"The team has been hard at work on the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/adobe\/brackets\/milestones\/Release%201.4\">1.4 release<\/a> and because it's taking a little bit longer I wanted to provide a quick update on that release as well as share some of the current thinking from the Adobe engineers about where we'll be focusing our efforts over the next few releases. \r\n\r\nOne of things we want to do as a team is plan our work around a specific theme for each release. That helps overall productivity for the team because they're diving into a specific area of Brackets but we're also hoping that it makes it easier for the community to contribute by being open about what kinds of pull requests we're likely to prioritize.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't mean that the only things that go into each Brackets release will be part of the theme. The other, non-Adobe committers all have their own priorities and things they want to get in so we'll still have nice, varied releases.\r\n\r\nBut on the Adobe side I wanted to share our current thinking. And all of this is subject to change based on continued feedback from all of you as well as the other committers. \r\n\r\nWe're also exploring using <a href=\"https:\/\/waffle.io\/adobe\/brackets\">Waffle a lot more<\/a> (versus <a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/b\/LCDud1Nd\/brackets\">Trello<\/a>) because so far the team likes how it integrates with Github. So you may see fewer updates to Trello and more information in Waffle as we get our process down. \r\n\r\n<h2>Release 1.4 - Performance!<\/h2>\r\nIt's been a while since we did a performance scrub and we thought this was an ideal time to do it. We're starting off by trying to measure where we are compared to other editors, then we're going to see what we can fix, and finally we're going to make those performance improvements. My hope is that every 6-9 months we could do another round of performance testing and optimization to keep Brackets running fast. We've been looking into a few areas:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/adobe\/brackets\/issues\/11094\">Switching between \/ opening files<\/a><\/li> \r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/adobe\/brackets\/issues\/11093\">Find in Files<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/adobe\/brackets\/issues\/11104\">Typing performance<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/adobe\/brackets\/issues\/11105\">Scrolling performance<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/adobe\/brackets\/issues\/11106\">Startup time<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nWe felt best about what improvements we could make to Switching between files and Find in Files so we're taking those for 1.4 and following up on the other items. <strong>We're hoping to release 1.4 in the next couple of weeks.<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<h2>Release 1.5 - Modern Workflows<\/h2>\r\nFor release 1.5 we want to make sure that the innovative Brackets features, like Live Preview, and Quick Edit work with modern web technologies like preprocessors and templating engines. We want to make things like Quick Edit work with preprocessor mixins, and also make Quick Hover work with colors and images you've defined as variables.\r\n\r\n<h2>Release 1.6 and 1.7 - Innovation<\/h2>\r\nThis one is a little bit more broad, but for the 1.6 and 1.7 releases we want to spend a lot of time thinking about what innovative features we can bring to Brackets. Things like Quick Edit and Live Preview that will help web designers and developers code faster. Some of the initial things we've brainstormed are CSS optimization tools, Grunt integration, and <a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/9IsdsBn3\/564-jump-to-html-code-in-brackets-by-selecting-in-browser-live-preview\">in-browser design tools<\/a>. As we get closer to the 1.6 release we'd love feedback and crazy ideas about what Brackets could do to help you.\r\n\r\n<h2>Release 1.8 - Core Editor Features<\/h2>\r\nOur 1.0 release marked the point where we felt like Brackets was really ready for prime time. But there are still some core editor improvements that we'd like to make. Some of the things that might fall into this bucket would be theming the entire UI, allowing multiple Brackets windows, non-UTF files and split view for more than 2 documents. This could also end up being a release where we do some work to improve the UI of the extension manager in Brackets.\r\n\r\nI hope this provides a bit of context to what we're planning and why. But as I said, we'd love to continue to get feedback about whether these themes\/features are the right  fit and what else might be missing for you in Brackets.
