        <h1 id="the-parse-database">Android Calculator</h1>
<p>Before you start the lab please update your Android Studio to version 1.5.2. If that is not available
for you then update to 2.3.2 stable version. If you did your pre-lab after 10 am today you do not do this step
as the page was updated to install the 1.5.2 version. When open
the Android Studio click on the <strong>gear wheel</strong> on the right bottom of the screen and click
on the <strong>check for updates</strong> option. Next click on <strong>Update and restart</strong> button
to update to 1.5.2 or 2.3.2 version, and make sure everything goes fine. Once the update is complete continue with the lab. Some parts could be little
different but nothing major should be different than the 1.5.1 version</p></br>

<h2 id="parse">Unit 1: Introduction to Android</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What is Android?
    <ul>
      <li>Android as many may know is an operating system offered by Google for mobile 
          devices. It uses java under the hood with many API offered by developers. An 
          application programming interface or API 
          is a library provided by other developers to facilitate certain generic 
          functionalities for Android developers to use. You could read more about it 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" 
          target="_blank">here</a>. Android applications can be developed for both phones 
          tablets that are running on Android OS. The latest version of Android at the 
          momment is called Android Nougat. IF intrested, more information can be accessed 
          <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/100109051988417688444" target="_blank">here</a>. 
          In the following lab some of the basic concepts will be covered to help get 
          aspiring Android developers to start exploring possibilties. The following lab is not a 
	  comprehensive tutorial but instead is a great start to an enjoyable adventure that 
          will hopefully inspire many great projects and products to come. Be bold, limitless 
          and don't be afraid of possibitlies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why Android?
    <ul>
      <li>In CSE110 there is 10 weeks (really more like 8) to develop an application that 
          works from the ground up and Android offers a great platfrom with a vibrant community
          and Google offers regular updates with
          new API every year that is announced during <a href="https://events.google.com/io2016/" 
          target="_blank">Google I/O event</a>.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In order to get the In Progress Check you will need to run the <strong>First Application</strong> application successfuly 
      on the day of the lab during your specific lab reservation time. </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="dependcies">Unit 2: Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Follow the pre-lab on how to download and install the 
      <a href="http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs110x/static/labs/lab3/index1.html" target="_blank">
      Android Studio</a></li>
<li>Start a new project. 
    <ul>      <li> Once the Android Studio program is launched click on the "Start a new 
                   Android Studio project" to create the first project.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image1.15.png" alt="image1" /></li>
              <li> Name the application "FirstApplication"<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image2.png" alt="image2" /></li>
              <li> The next page asks for the form factors and minimum SDK that a develpor 
                   would like their application to run on. The minimum SDK refers to the version 
                   of android any device running the application will be required to have in order 
                   to run properly. Select "API 15: Android 4.0.3(IceCreamSandwich) and click Next
		   <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image3.png" alt="image3" />
              </li>
              <li>Next there will be series of template "Activities" to add to the application. 
                  Selecting these activities will configure the application for specific tasks 
                  such as the "Login Activity". For now select the "Basic Activity" and select Next. 
                  Later additonal activities could be added.
		  <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image4.png" alt="image4" />
              </li>
              <li>Name the activity HelloWorld and click Finish. Android studio will now create the
                  project.
              </li>
              <li>The project will now generates all the necessary files to create the application 
                  which will load in a window similar the one below after about 1-2 minutes.
                      <ul><li>Note: if the project view (left side of the screen) looks different than 
                          the image below, click the dropdown menu in the upper left (labeled "Android") 
                          and change the view to match.
                      </li>
                      <li>Alternatively navigate to FirstApplication -&gt; app -&gt; src -&gt; main -&gt; 
                          java -&gt; com.mycompany.firstapplication -&gt; HelloWorld.java
                      </li></ul>

              </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h2 id="creating">Unit 3: Creating Android Projects</h2>
  <li>Creating an Android Virtual machine.
          <ul><li>Next, right click on the canvas (where the code is) and select <strong>Run 'HelloWorld'</strong> 
                  or click the play button at the top of the screen. The program will then compile 
                  and a pop up window will display after some time prompting to select a virtual machine.
		  <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image6.png" alt="image6" />
		  </li>
              <li>Click the <strong>...</strong> to the right of the drop down box to create a virtual machine to run the
                  program in that environment.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image7.png" alt="image7" /></li>
              <li>Select <strong>Create a virtual device</strong>. The user will be prompted to a new screen asking
                  to select a category, select <strong>Phone</strong>. A list of phone models will appear to the 
                  right of the screen select the <strong>Nexus 5</strong>. If the machine being used has 2GB or less 
                  dedicated to the Virtual Machine, then choosing <strong>Nexus 4</strong>instead is recomended.
		  <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image8.png" alt="image8" /></li>
              <li>Next select the API that the VM Phone will run. Select the x86 appropriate to the machine being used. 
                  X86_64 for 64 bit machines and x86 for 32 bit machines. Click Next and choose the latest version of 
                  android <strong>Nougat</strong>. Click <strong>Download</strong><img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image10.png" alt="image9" /></li>
              <li>Once the desired version has been downloaded then click on the <strong>next</strong> button.
		  <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image10.png" alt="image10" /></li>
              <li>In the next step a screen will be presented to finalize the emulator. Leave the defaults values 
                  selected and select <strong>finish</strong>. The virtual machine will then be created. This may 
                  take a few moments, especially if the program is running on VMware. If the emulator is running
                  really slow then using a physical android phone will be more convinient. Just hook up the
                  device to the machine and choose the device from the connected devices instead choosing an emulator
                  (There is a description few steps back on this topic).<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image11.png" alt="image11" /></li>
              <li>When the VM is created the AVD Manager will appear. This is the screen where you can manage all the various virtual
                  devices that have been created in order to test the android application. Choose the device and click <strong>Ok</strong>
		  <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image13.png" alt="image12" /></li>
              <li>At this point the system should boot up the VM and run the program that was just created.If 
                  nothing happens close Android Studio and reopen it. Try to run the program again</li> 
                  <ul><li>If one of the errors shown in the images below occurs try the following fixes
		          <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image14.png" alt="image1" /><img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image15.png" alt="image14" /></li>
                      <li><strong>Linux Users:</strong> to fix shut down the Virtual Machine and click Edit 
                          virtual machine settings -&gt; Processors. Click to enable Virtualize Intel <strong>VT-x/EPT</strong>

	    <strong>First Application</strong> application along with your lab reservation time</li>
<hr/>
<h2 id="unit4">Unit 4: More Complicated Application</h2>
	<li>Now you will be creating a second application that does a little more than just printing "Hello World!"
		<ul><li>Start by creating a new project by going to <strong>File -&gt; New -&gt; New Projects</strong>.</li>
		    <li>Name the project <strong>Simple Calculator</strong>.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image23.1.png" alt="image23.1" /></li>
		    <li>In the next screen enable <strong>the Phone and Tablet</strong> and choose the <strong>API 15</strong> from the drop down menu.
				<ul><li>This option allows you to pick what versions of Android OS your application will support.
				    API 15 supports 97.3% of Android users so it is a good place to start. <strong>API 24</strong> is the current
				    version(Nougat).<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image24.1.png" alt="image24.1" /></li>
				</ul>
		    </li>
		    <li>Next select a blank activity.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image24.png" alt="image24" /></li>
		    <li>Keep the default names and click finish.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image25.png" alt="image25" /></li>
		    <li>Now the project should be loaded to see a more complete view of an Android project. Select <strong>Android</strong>
			in the upper left hand corner, a drop down menu should appear. Select <strong>Project</strong> this will change to
			project view.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image26.png" alt="image26" />
		    </li>
		    <li>Now open <strong>SimpleCalculator -&gt; app -&gt; src -&gt; main -&gt; java -&gt; (package name) -&gt; MainActivity
			</strong> from the panel on the left side of the IDE.
				 <ul><li>This is your actvities main class, which is very similar to java's main. When the application is run, this is
				     the code that starts your app.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image27.9.png" alt="image27" /></li></ul></li>
		    <li>The next few bullets will demonstrate how Androd controls it's visual layer or View.
			<ul>
		    	<li>From the left side panel open <strong>res -&gt; layout</strong>.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image28.png" alt="image28" /></li>
			<li>Under the <strong>layout</strong> subdirectory you will see two files <strong>activity_main.xml</strong> and <strong>content_main.xml</strong>
			    .These two files control the default layout for your activity. <strong>activity_main.xml</strong> contains the
			    starter code for your application and at the bottom links in the <strong>content_main.xml</strong>. <strong>content_main.xml</strong> is
			    where we will be adding content to update how our application looks.
			    <li>First remove some irelavant code from the <strong>activity_main.xml</strong>. Double click and open the <strong>activity_main.xml</strong>
				. You should see the below screen.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image28.1.png" alt="image28.1" /></li>
			    <li>Click on the <strong>Text</strong> tab in the bottom right corner, next to <strong>Design</strong> tab. Now delete the
				<strong>FloatingActionButton</strong> as seen in the highlighted code in the image below. This will remove the extra email button that
				can be seen in the above image.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image28.2.png" alt="image28.2" />
				<ul><li>In Android Studio you can edit .xml or design code in either design mode or text mode. Text mode is more powerful in the sense
				    that it gives you the full power of xml but design allows for a drag and drop interface which is convenient for simple tasks.</li>
				</ul>
			    </li>
			</li></ul>
		    </li>
		    <li>Now open <strong>content_main.xml</strong>. By default the layout has been set to a <strong>Relative Layout</strong> which
			allows you to position items relative to other items on the screen. Change that to <strong>Linear Layout</strong> which
			stacks elements lineraly. This will be simpler to write for our purpose.
			<ul><li>Currently your <strong>content_main.xml</strong> looks like the image below. Change the <strong>RelativeLayout</strong> 
			    to <strong>LinearLayout</strong>.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image29.png" alt="image29" /></li>
			<li>Once you make the changes in the opening and closing tags click back to the <strong>Design</strong> tab.</li>
			</ul>
		    </li>
		    <li>Now look to the upper right hand corner of the screen and you will see a <strong>Component Tree</strong> view that outlines
			all the elements currently in your view.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image30.png" alt="image30" />			
			<ul><li>When you select a component in the tree it will highlight it on the virtual phone. Use this to delete the <strong>TextView</strong>
			    containing <strong>Hello World</strong><img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image31.png" alt="image31" /></li>
			</ul>
		    </li>
<h2 id="unti5">Unit 5: Designing the Interface</h2>
		    <li>Now you will be using the Design mode to set up the layout for our calculator!
			<ul><li>Start by clicking the background inside the <strong>Properties</strong> section on the right hand side.
			    Click the <strong>...</strong>to get a color wheel displayed. Select the background color for your calculator.
			    <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image31.1.png" alt="image31" /></li>
			<li>Now add a <strong>TextView</strong> to display the applications title. On the left hand toolbar select <strong>Large Text</strong> and drag it onto 
			    the phone screen.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image32.png" alt="image32" /></li>
			<li>When you drag you will notice that there is only one place you can put the item on the screen. This is because 
			    you are using a <strong>Linear Layout</strong> which either stacks items horizontally or vertically.
			    <li>Now if you double click on the item you can change the displayed text. Change it to <strong>Simple Calculator</strong>. 
			        The second field id is the name of the element. This is used to identify the <strong>TextView</strong> inside the 
				application itself. Change id to <strong>title</strong>.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image33.png" alt="image33" /></li>
			    <li>Now center the text.
				<ul><li>First you need to change the <strong>layout:width</strong> property to <strong>match_parent</strong> this will 
				    cause the text element's width to match the parent which in this case is the <strong>LinearLayout</strong>. Causing 
				    it to span the entire screen.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image34.png" alt="image34"/>
				    <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image35.png" alt="image35"/></li>		
				<li>Now that the element spans the entire horizontal space you need to center it inside the space. Under <strong>Properties</strong> 
				    scroll down to <strong>gravity</strong>, click the triangular drop down and select <strong>center_horizontal</strong>.
				    <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image36.png" alt="image36"/></li>
				</ul>
			    </li>
			    <li>Now you need to add two fields for the number inputs.
				<ul><li>First you need to make sure elements inside the LinearLayout Stack are vertical. To do this Click on the <strong>LinearLayout 
				    </strong> inside the <strong>Component Tree</strong> and change the orientation field inside <strong>Properties</strong> 
				    to <strong>vertical</strong>.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image37.png" alt="image37"/></li>
				<li>Next add two <strong>Plain Text</strong> elements from the <strong>Text</strong> fields area under the left hand toolbar. 
				    The screen should look like the one below when done.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image38.png" alt="image38"/></li>
				<li>Edit the id of both new <strong>editText</strong> and <strong>editText2</strong> to read <strong>input1</strong> and 
				    <strong>input2</strong>.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image39.png" alt="image39"/></li>
				<li>Finally set the input type so that the inputs entered in by the user are only decimal.
				    <ul><li>Go to <strong>Properties -&gt; InputType -&gt; numberDecimal</strong> and check this option. Checking this will 
					restrict users to only inputting numbers and will display the number pad when an input is clicked.
					<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image40.png" alt="image40"/>
					<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image41.png" alt="image41"/></li>
				    </ul>
				</li>
				</ul>
			    </li>
			    <li>Next add the basic math buttons.
				<ul>
				<li>Insert a <strong>LinearLayout Horizontal</strong> below the 2 inputs. Next drag 5 <strong>Small Button</strong> items 
				    into the new <strong>LinearLayout</strong> and the result should look like the below image.
				    <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image42.png" alt="image42"/></li>
				<li>Now name the buttons you created. For Text field of <strong>Button</strong> enter <strong>+</strong> and for 
				    <strong>Id</strong> field enter <strong>plus</strong> for <strong>Button2</strong> enter <strong>-</strong> and 
				    <strong>minus</strong> for Text and Id fields respectively. For <strong>Button3</strong> enter <strong>*</strong> and 
                                    <strong>multiply</strong> for Text and Id fields respectively. For <strong>Button4</strong> enter <strong>/</strong> and 
                                    <strong>divide</strong> for Text and Id fields respectively and for <strong>Button5</strong> enter <strong>CLR</strong> and 
                                    <strong>clear</strong> for Text and Id fields respectively.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image42.1.png" alt="image42"/></li> 
				<li>See if you can figure out how to center the buttons. To give you a hint, it is a property of the parent's layout.</li>
				<li>Finally make sure your <strong>Horizontal LinearLayout</strong> has the following properties before moving on.</li>
					<ul><li>Note that you can drag an object between the linear layouts by clicking and holding the object.</li></ul>
				</ul>
			    </li>
			    <li>Now you need to add space to display the final results
				<ul><li>Add a <strong>LinearLayout Vertical</strong> below <strong>LinearLaytout Horizontal</strong> Then add two plain
				    <strong>Plain TextView</strong> items below that. Make sure that for the <strong>LinearLayout</strong> that you just
				    added, <strong>layout:width and layout:height</strong> matches the parent. The result should look like the image below.</li>
				    <li>Experiment with the text size and style inside the <strong>Properties</strong> toolbar for both text views but
					give them the id's <strong>result_title</strong> and <strong>result</strong>
					<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image43.png" alt="image43"/></li>
			    </li>
			</li>
			</ul>
		    </li>
		    <li>Open <strong>MainActivity</strong> to link the functionality of the calculator to the simple design you implemented above.
			<ul><li>Start by deleting the hightlighted code shown below. This code implements the <strong>FloatingActionButton</strong>
				you deleted from your <strong>activity_main.xml</strong>.<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image43.1.png" alt="image43.1" /></li>
			    <li>When you generated your blank activity, Android Studio created a lot of starter code for you. One of these methods
				is <strong>onCreate</strong> method; this method is called when the activity or application starts up. This is
				what links your Design code or <strong>View</Strong> from your functional code or <strong>Controller</strong>
				<ul><li>This process starts with the line <code>setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);</code></br>This will link the application's
				    <strong>MainActivity</strong> to the application's <strong>actvity_main</strong> and <strong>content_main</strong>.</li></ul>
			    </li>
			    <li>Create the following fields above the <strong>onCreate</strong> method. These fields are the instances of the objects that
				help you to control your application's layout.</br>
				    <code>private EditText operand1;</code></br> <code>private EditText operand2;</code></br> <code>private Button btnAddition;</code></br>
				    <code>private Button btnSubtraction;</code></br> <code>private Button btnDivision;</code></br> <code>private Button btnMultiplication;</code></br>
				    <code>private TextView txtResult;</code></br> <code>private Button btnClear;</code></br>
				<ul><li>If there are any errors like the one below you can click on the line where error is occuring and use <strong>
				    alt+ctrl</strong> to import the necessary library for any of the objects you created.
				    <img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image44.png" alt="image44"/></li></ul>
			    </li>
			    <li>Under <strong>setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);</strong> add the following lines of code where each of thsese
				lines will link an element from the content_main.xml to one of the fields that you just created above. This is
				achieved by using the <strong>findViewBy()</strong> function which you can use to look up ids you assigned inside
				<strong>content_main.xml</strong></br>
				<code>operand1 = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.input1);</code></br> <code>operand2 = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.input2);</code></br> 
				<code>btnAddition = (Button) findViewById(R.id.plus);</code></br> <code>btnSubtraction = (Button) findViewById(R.id.minus);</code></br>
				<code>btnDivision = (Button) findViewById(R.id.divide);</code></br> <code>btnMultiplication = (Button) findViewById(R.id.multiply);</code></br>
				<code>txtResult = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.result);</code></br> <code>btnClear = (Button) findViewById(R.id.clear);</code>
				<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image45.png" alt="image45"/>
			    </li>
			    <li>Now you need to set up listeners for the buttons you created for the <strong>View</strong> of your application. Listeners
				will take responds from users and connect the requests to the controller of your application so the application can
				perform the requested function. For this application you will use simple <strong>onClickListeners</strong>. They detect
				when one of the buttons is clicked by the user. Android has a variety of built in listeners for things such as swipes,
				taps, and more.The "listener" or "observer" pattern is the most common strategy for creating asynchronous callbacks 
				within Android development. Listeners are used for any type of asynchronous event in order to implement the code to 
				run when an event occurs. You could read more about listeners here.
				<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/ui-events.html" target="_blank">Link to listeners</a> 
				<ul><li>You need to setup the <strong>setOnClicker</strong> like shown below. <strong>setOnClickListener</strong> 
					is a method of the <strong>Button</strong> object in Android. This generates a new View and Override its 
					<strong>onClick</strong> method.</li>
				    <li>Now when the button is clicked, the code inside <strong>onClick</strong> is run which in this case, takes the input 
					the user has placed in both <strong>input1</strong> and <strong>input2</strong> TextViews and stores them as doubles. 
					The addition operation is performed and then the <strong>result</strong> TextView is updated to display the results 
					to the user. Else if the inputs are not valid a popup prompting the user to enter a valid input is displayed.</li>
				    <li>Place the following code at the bottom of the <strong>onCreate()</strong> method.
				    <pre>btnAddition.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){
						@Override
						public void onClick(View v){
							if ((operand1.getText().length() &gt; 0) && (operand2.getText().length() &gt; 0 )){
								double oper1 = Double.parseDouble(operand1.getText().toString());
								double oper2 = Double.parseDouble(operand2.getText().toString());
								double theResult = oper1 + oper2;
								txtResult.setText(Double.toString(theResult));
							}
							else{
								Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Please enter number in both operand fields", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
							}
						}
					});
				    </pre>
					<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image45.1.png" alt="image45.1"/>
				</ul>
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Now implement the subtraction, multiplication, division functionalities of your application following similar
				process as addition that you followed above.Ensure to name the <strong>btn</strong> according to its functionality.
				For example for division the button is called <strong>btnDivision</strong>.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				At last you need to setup the clear button which will reset the inputs and the result display. Add the following
				code after your button code that you added in the <strong>onCreate()</strong> method.
				<pre>btnClear.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){
                                     	@Override
                       			public void onClick(View v){
							operand1.setText("");
							operand2.setText("");
							txtResult.setText("0.00");
							operand1.requestFocus();
                                                }
                                     });
                                    </pre>
			    </li>
			    <li>Now test your application. In the upper right hand corner click on the play button.
				<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image45.2.png" alt="image45.2"/>
				<ul><li>A window like below will pop-up. Choose the <strong>Launch emulator</strong> and click
					<strong>OK</strong> and this will launch the emulator for you.
					<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image46.png" alt="image46"/></li>
				    <li>Once the emulator is launched you should see the following. 
					<img src="/~cs110x/static/img/newLab3/image47.png" alt="image47"/></li>
				</ul>
			    <li>Great!! you have built some functional apps in Android. This might be a great start to more interesting adventures for you.</li>
			</ul>
		    </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
     	

  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="completion----"> --<strong>Completion Check</strong>--</h1>
<p>When you reach the screen shown in image above, add a ticket to the Autograder queue with one tag for the priority of your
   ticket and another with lab completion check tag so a member of the staff will help you. However bear
   in mind that you will only get checkoff prioirty during your own lab reservation time. During any other
   CSE 110 lab hour your checkoff request will be considered only if there are staff members who are not
   helping students from that lab hour.Select your lab reservartion time correctly otherwise you will earn a 
   professionalism deduction</p>
